## Project Purpose and Vision

### Core Mission

The ZeroTrust IAM Analyzer aims to provide comprehensive security analysis for identity and access management policies across multi-cloud environments, delivering actionable insights based on NIST SP 800-207 Zero Trust principles.

### Problem Statement

**Current Challenges in Cloud IAM Management:**

1. **Fragmented Security Visibility**
   - Organizations use multiple cloud providers (Azure, GCP, AWS)
   - No unified view of IAM security posture
   - Manual policy reviews are time-consuming and error-prone
   - Lack of standardized security assessment frameworks

2. **Zero Trust Adoption Complexity**
   - NIST SP 800-207 provides comprehensive guidance but lacks implementation tools
   - Organizations struggle to measure Zero Trust compliance
   - Gap between security principles and practical implementation
   - Need for continuous monitoring and assessment

3. **Compliance and Audit Requirements**
   - Increasing regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001)
   - Need for documented evidence of security controls
   - Regular security assessments required
   - Audit trails and historical tracking needed

4. **Expertise Gap**
   - Cloud IAM security requires specialized knowledge
   - Shortage of security professionals with multi-cloud expertise
   - Need for automated guidance and recommendations
   - Best practices vary across cloud providers

### Solution Approach

**ZeroTrust IAM Analyzer addresses these challenges by:**

1. **Unified Multi-Cloud Analysis**
   - Single platform for Azure AD, GCP IAM, and Google Workspace
   - Consistent security assessment across all platforms
   - Centralized dashboard with unified metrics

2. **NIST SP 800-207 Alignment**
   - Built-in Zero Trust tenet assessment (7 core tenets)
   - Quantitative scoring (0-100 scale)
   - Gap analysis identifying compliance deficiencies
   - Prioritized recommendations for improvement

3. **Automated Security Assessment**
   - Continuous policy monitoring and drift detection
   - Automated scanning with configurable frequency
   - Real-time alerting for policy changes
   - Historical trend analysis and reporting

4. **Actionable Guidance**
   - Specific, implementable security recommendations
   - Priority-based remediation roadmap
   - Integration with native cloud tools
   - Export capabilities for compliance documentation

### Strategic Vision

**Short-Term (6-12 months):**

## Next Steps

See [08-recommendations.md](./08-recommendations.md) for detailed immediate actions and [09-roadmap.md](./09-roadmap.md) for comprehensive development plan.

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. Install missing dependencies (Azure SDK, GCP SDK, pytest)
2. Initialize Alembic and create database migrations
3. Implement authentication API endpoints
4. Write core security tests (JWT, password hashing, user model)
5. Create first scan endpoint (Azure AD only for MVP)
