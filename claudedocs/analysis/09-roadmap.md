# Development Roadmap - ZeroTrust IAM Analyzer

**Analysis Date**: October 24, 2025
**Roadmap Version**: 1.0
**Planning Methodology**: B-MAD Method v6, Story-Based Development
**Timeline**: 6-10 weeks MVP, 3-6 months Full Platform, 6-12 months Production

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a detailed, phase-based plan for developing the ZeroTrust IAM Analyzer from its current early-stage scaffolding (10-15% complete) to a production-ready, multi-cloud Zero Trust compliance platform. The roadmap is organized into 7 major phases spanning 6-12 months, with a focus on delivering an Azure-only MVP in 6-10 weeks followed by iterative expansion to full functionality.

**Roadmap Principles**:
- **Iterative Development**: Deliver value incrementally with regular releases
- **User-Centered**: Validate features with beta users before expanding
- **Quality-First**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage throughout development
- **Risk-Driven**: Address highest-risk items early (authentication, cloud integration)
- **Scale-Adaptive**: Start with MVP (L2), escalate to full platform (L3)

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Timeline Risks

**Risk 1: Azure API Complexity Higher Than Expected**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: 2-4 week delay
- **Mitigation**: Prototype Azure integration in Week 3, allocate buffer time

**Risk 2: Scoring Algorithm Accuracy Issues**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: 1-2 week delay
- **Mitigation**: Early validation with manual assessments, iterate based on feedback

**Risk 3: Scope Creep**
- **Probability**: High
- **Impact**: 4-8 week delay
- **Mitigation**: Strict MVP scope, defer features to post-MVP, regular scope reviews

### Technical Risks

**Risk 4: Performance Issues at Scale**
- **Probability**: Medium (for production)
- **Impact**: 2-4 week delay
- **Mitigation**: Load testing, caching strategy, background job processing

**Risk 5: Cloud Provider API Changes**
- **Probability**: Low
- **Impact**: 1-2 week delay
- **Mitigation**: Version pinning, monitoring API deprecation notices, automated tests

### Business Risks

**Risk 6: Low User Adoption**
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Impact**: Pivot required
- **Mitigation**: User interviews, beta testing, marketing strategy, community building

**Risk 7: Competitive Pressure**
- **Probability**: High
- **Impact**: Feature parity pressure
- **Mitigation**: Focus on unique value (NIST alignment, open source), rapid iteration

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a **comprehensive, phase-based development plan** for the ZeroTrust IAM Analyzer spanning 6-12 months from early-stage scaffolding to production-ready platform. The roadmap prioritizes delivering an Azure-only MVP in 6-10 weeks to validate the core value proposition before expanding to multi-cloud support and advanced features.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **Iterative Development**: Deliver value incrementally with regular releases
2. **User Feedback**: Validate features with beta users at each phase
3. **Quality-First**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage throughout
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Address high-risk items early (auth, cloud integration)
5. **Scope Discipline**: Resist feature creep, defer non-critical features

**Recommended Execution**:
- Start with B-MAD Phase 2 (Planning) to create detailed PRD
- Follow story-based development with 1-2 week sprints
- Conduct weekly demos and retrospectives
- Implement CI/CD from Week 1-2
- Document architecture and decisions continuously

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 0 (Planning) to create detailed Product Requirements Document and user stories.
