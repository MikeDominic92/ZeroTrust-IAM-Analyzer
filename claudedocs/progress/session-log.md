# Session Log

This file tracks all development sessions chronologically for the ZeroTrust IAM Analyzer project. Each entry captures session metadata, work completed, and next steps to support crash recovery and project continuity.

## Session 1
**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Branch**: main
**Status**: Completed

### Session Goals
- Initialize GitHub repository and project structure
- Create comprehensive documentation suite
- Establish crash recovery strategy
- Set up initial task tracking

### Work Completed

#### Repository Setup
- Created GitHub repository: MikeDominic92/ZeroTrust-IAM-Analyzer
- Configured repository description: "Python-based Zero Trust IAM policy analyzer"
- Set up GitHub workflow for automated repository management
- Cloned repository to local development environment: ~/github-projects/MikeDominic92/ZeroTrust-IAM-Analyzer

#### Documentation Suite Created (17 Files)
1. **Project Foundation**
   - README.md: Project overview, features, installation, usage
   - LICENSE: MIT License for open-source distribution
   - .gitignore: Python-specific patterns

2. **Architecture & Planning** (claudedocs/)
   - architecture.md: System design, components, data flow
   - roadmap.md: Development phases and milestones
   - executive-summary.md: High-level project overview

3. **Task Management** (claudedocs/tasks/)
   - TODO.md: Master task list with status tracking (31 tasks across 4 phases)

4. **Technical Documentation** (claudedocs/analysis/)
   - zero-trust-principles.md: Zero Trust fundamentals
   - iam-analysis-methodology.md: Analysis approach and techniques
   - threat-model.md: Security threats and attack vectors
   - compliance-requirements.md: Regulatory standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)

5. **Development Guides** (claudedocs/guides/)
   - development-setup.md: Environment configuration
   - testing-strategy.md: Testing approach and standards
   - contribution-guidelines.md: How to contribute

6. **Progress Tracking** (claudedocs/progress/)
   - PROGRESS.md: Overall project status (0% complete)

#### Commits Made
- Commit 1: "[Setup] Initialize repository with comprehensive documentation suite"
  - All 17 files created and committed
  - Pushed to GitHub successfully

### Files Modified
- Created: 17 files (full documentation suite)
- Modified: 0 files (all new files)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Clone repository to local environment
- [x] Create documentation structure (claudedocs/)
- [x] Write comprehensive README.md
- [x] Create architecture documentation
- [x] Create roadmap and task breakdown
- [x] Set up task tracking (TODO.md)
- [x] Write Zero Trust principles guide
- [x] Document IAM analysis methodology
- [x] Create threat model documentation
- [x] Document compliance requirements
- [x] Create development setup guide
- [x] Write testing strategy
- [x] Create contribution guidelines
- [x] Initialize progress tracking
- [x] Commit and push documentation suite

### Key Decisions
- Adopted ADR (Architecture Decision Records) format for decisions
- Established commit-after-every-task strategy for crash recovery
- Created claudedocs/ structure with 4 subdirectories (analysis, tasks, decisions, progress)
- Used Markdown for all documentation (consistency and tooling support)

### Challenges Encountered
- None (smooth initialization session)

### Next Steps
1. Create ADR 001: Documentation structure decision
2. Create ADR 002: Commit strategy decision
3. Create session-1-summary.md for comprehensive session review
4. Update README.md with documentation section
5. Begin Phase 1 implementation: Project setup and core infrastructure

### Notes
- All documentation follows professional standards with no emojis
- ASCII markers used for consistency: [+], [!], [*], [NB]
- Project ready for development to begin
- Documentation provides strong foundation for crash recovery
