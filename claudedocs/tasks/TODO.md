## Task Dependencies Graph

**Critical Path** (must be completed sequentially):
1. Phase 0.1-0.8 â†’ Phase 1.1-1.13 â†’ Phase 2.1-2.19 â†’ Phase 3 â†’ Phase 4 â†’ Phase 6

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Phase 4 (Frontend) can start after Phase 2.16-2.19 (API endpoints ready)
- Phase 3.1-3.5 (Unit tests) can be written alongside Phase 2 implementation
- Phase 5 (Multi-cloud) can start after Phase 2 MVP is stable

## Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:

1. **Functional**: All acceptance criteria met and verified
2. **Tested**: Unit tests written with passing coverage
3. **Documented**: Code includes docstrings and inline comments
4. **Reviewed**: Code passes quality checks (type hints, linting, formatting)
5. **Integrated**: Changes merged to main branch without breaking existing functionality
6. **Validated**: Manual testing confirms expected behavior
